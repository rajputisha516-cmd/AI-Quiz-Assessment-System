# AI Quiz Assessment System

This repository contains my **AI Quiz Assessment System** project built using **Python and Streamlit**.

The project is currently in a **Work in Progress (WIP)** stage.  
Right now, my main focus is on understanding quiz flow, question handling, and assessment logic rather than deployment or authentication.

## About the Project

The aim of this project is to build a quiz-based assessment system that can later be extended into an adaptive or intelligent quiz platform.

At this stage, the project helps me practice:
- Designing quiz flow
- Rendering questions and options
- Managing user interaction in Streamlit
- Thinking about feature engineering for assessment systems

---

## Current Features

- Quiz interface using Streamlit  
- Question display with multiple options  
- Basic quiz flow handling  
- Desktop and mobile browser friendly UI  

---

## Tech Stack

- Python  
- Streamlit  
- SQLite (experimental / not finalized)  
- Git & GitHub

## Project Structure

- app.py  
- auth/
  - login.py (experimental, WIP)
- data/
  - users.db (local / not deployed)
- ui/
  - styles.py
  - components.py

## Project Status

- Authentication logic: Not finalized  
- Feature engineering: In progress  
- Deployment: Not done yet  

This is intentional, as I want to strengthen the core logic before moving ahead.

## Learning Goals

Through this project, I am learning:
- How assessment systems are structured
- How to work with Streamlit for interactive applications
- How to iterate on a project instead of rushing to finish it
- Real-world project workflow using Git and GitHub

---

## Future Scope

- Improve quiz logic and feature engineering
- Add adaptive difficulty
- Finalize authentication flow
- Deploy the application
- Add analytics and scoring insights
